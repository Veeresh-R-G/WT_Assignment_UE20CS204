#### I have used POSTMAN to perform GET / POST / PUT Requests 
#### For those of you who deos not to know what POSTMAN is.. Scroll Down ( 5 - 10 min read)
### <ins> POSTMAN TUTORIAL </ins> <br>
#### You can Download POSTMAN From here : https://www.postman.com/downloads/

#### So, POSTMAN is an platform which used to test , create and playaround with API's. This tool / platform comes in handy when we want to test API's . It accelerates the API Lifecycle which helps us to create better yet faster API<br>

> #### Simple Steps to start working with POSTMAN : <br>
> #### 1.First Type in the URL or the _API END POINT_ that we want to test<br>
> #### 2.Select the HTTP protocol<br>
> #### 3.Click on send <br>
#### Yes its that Simple<br>
##### Now Lets take an Example<br>

##### **_GET REQUEST_**

##### **_POST REQUEST_**

##### An Important point to be noted here is I have changed the protocol to POST HERE
##### Though I am not sending Any data to the server does not mean my POST request is invalid , It still is VALID !!!<br>You can hence create more api end points and choose appropriate HTTP Protocols and play-around with API using POSTMAN


#### Note : This is only for ODD SRN's . EVEN SRN's can also use this as a reference and do the same.
